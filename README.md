# OpenRA: Tiberian Aurora

OpenRA泰伯利亚曙光(Tiberian Aurora，TA)是由EoralMilk发起制作的一个OpenRA第三方模组，旨在以现代化的高清素材、新一代OpenRA第三方引擎与第二世代CNC的游戏视角来重现泰伯利亚黎明的经典。全部建筑和单位素材都将重制，届时将为大家展现一个全新体验的TD。(其实是一个二次元向mod)

- 目前TA尚在开发中。
目前ta正在封闭开发，github没有进度属于正常现象

OpenRA-Tiberian Aurora is a third-party mod that contains self-made assets and models, unique visual, sound, and animation effects, also some (actually lots of and would be more) elements from anime.
The goal is to represent (and might change a little of), Tiberian Dawn, in a highly customized OpenRA-RA2 engine and also seriously adding (lots of) anime elements. Well, the most important cat ears are still missing.

Currently ta is under closed development, it is normal that Github has no progress
